  <Medieval_Bandit.description>A group of bandits gathered for their own purposes.

Bandits don't sow, they don't build, and they rarely trade. Driven by a blood-and-honor culture that values personal strength and ruthlessness, they enrich themselves by raiding and robbing their more productive neighbors.

Their technology level depends mostly on who they've managed to steal from recently. They have a preferrance for setting fire.</Medieval_Bandit.description>
